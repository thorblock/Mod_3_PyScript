# Module_3_Py_Challenge
Two challenges: PyBank and PyPoll, script generation, and data analysis.

## PyBank and PyPoll Folders
When you run the main.py script for each, there are two things to note:
  1. If you downloaded it overall as a compressed zip file, you have to extract and run from the non-compressed file. Otherwise, it gets funky.
  2. Working directory can be the general folder; adjustments have been made to CSV read path

## PyBank notes incomplete
Two folders,  PyBank_main.py script, and a Jupyter notebook. The Jupyter Notebook is more for my benefit as I wanted to segment code to make sure each piece ran correctly. The culmination of that is the PyBank_main.py script. Regardless, both reference the Resources folder wherein the budget_data.csv lives. The TB Analysis folder contains the assignment results formatted as a text file.

## PyPoll notes complete
Again, two folders,  PyPoll_main.py script, and a Jupyter notebook. Jupyter notebook as a reference for my fondness of Rstudio code blocks. Content-wise, the notebook and the .py script contain the same things. Although there is some slight reordering such that the print statements output the right jazz in the correct order. Script references the election_data.csv file. TB Analysis contains the results formatted as a text file.


Sadly, no pandas for this assignment. So, I experienced the unabated force that is dictionaries, keys, and lists.
